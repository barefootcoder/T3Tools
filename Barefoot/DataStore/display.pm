#
###########################################################################
#
# The display() function accepts a file which contains mostly basic SQL
# commands, with the possible addition of some more sophisticated formatting
# options, and produces a string which is (hopefully) ready for printing.
#
# Example:
#
#		print DataStore::display($ds, $filename);
#
# #########################################################################
#
# In general, the file is processed moderately simply.  Blank lines (this
# includes lines containing only whitespace) are ignored in every case
# except the &print command (see below).  From the first occurence of a #
# to the end of that line is considered a comment, and is removed, except
# in the ->format section (see below).  A semicolon on a line by itself,
# or on a line with nothing other than whitespace, terminates the current
# command in every case (no exceptions).
#
# There are several kinds of commands allowed in the file.  Here are some
# examples:
#
#			select *
#			from my_table
#			;
#
# This is a simple SQL query.  Since there is no ->format section, you
# will get default output: for select's, a simple double header row (column
# names followed by dashes), each row lined up with the headers, and a
# footer row like: "(6 rows returned)"; for insert's, update's, and delete's,
# a single row like: "(6 rows affected)".  If the data store returns an
# error, the error is output instead.  The width of a column is the width
# of its largest data memeber, or its header, whichever is longer.  All
# columns are left justified and no attempt is made to line up decimals
# or reformat dates.
#
# To get more control over the output of a select, you could do this:
#
#			select *
#			from my_table
#		->format
#			H->@<<<  @|||  @>>>>
#			H->----  ----  =====
#			B->@<<<  @|||  @#.##
#			F=>(%R rows)
#		;
#
# The ->format introduces a section which lasts up until the terminating
# semicolon.  A format consists of three subsections: H (header), B (body),
# and F (footer).  The body format is output once for every row of output;
# the others are output once only.  If any of the three subsections is
# omitted, there will be no output for that section.  For each subsection,
# you may describe the output in one of three ways: -> (a Perl format with
# default values), -> followed by /> (a Perl format with specified values),
# or => (a "literal" which will allow some simple substitutions).  A ->
# or => line extends from the next character after the > up to (and
# including) the newline (which means it's not possible to specify format
# lines that don't end in newlines).  Multiple lines beginning with the
# same characters (like the two H-> lines above) get concatenated together,
# but don't try to mix and match types (for instance, a H-> and H=> in the
# same ->format section wouldn't work, but obviously -> and /> are the
# exception).  Completely blank lines are ignored, as they are almost
# everywhere else, but you can get a blank line in your format by just
# putting the intro characters on a line by themselves.  For instance, this
# would give you a blank line between the data rows and the main footer
# row:
#
#			select *
#			from my_table
#		->format
#			H->@<<<  @|||  @>>>>
#			H->----  ----  =====
#			B->@<<<  @|||  @#.##
#			F=>
#			F=>(%R rows)
#		;
#
# The /> lines are parsed differently: whitespace is completely ignored,
# and the line is split on commas into fields.  Each field could be a
# literal in quotes (for instance, having a "@" in the field list is the
# only way to get a literal @ in your format line, as is true in Perl
# itself).  More likely, it is a database field, which is a % followed by
# either a number or a name which indicates which column from the select
# statement you want.  In the header, database fields get replaced by the
# column names (which makes %name type fields somewhat useless there); in
# the body, database fields get replaced by the values of the columns.
# Using database fields in the footer is an error.  There is also a special
# field, %R, which represents the total number of rows in either the header
# or footer, or the current row number in the body.  These fields may be
# used in /> lines or => lines.  When using -> lines, however, it is
# extremely common that your /> line will consist of %1, %2, %3 etc until
# all fields are exhausted.  Since this is the most common case, it is the
# default: a -> line with no following /> line acts in this way (except in
# footer subsections, where that wouldn't make any sense).  However, if you
# wanted to add the row number to the body, you'd need to specify all the
# fields.  Here is an example:
#
#			select *
#			from my_table
#		->format
#			H-> #  @<<<  @|||  @>>>>
#			H->--- ----  ----  =====
#			B->@>> @<<<  @|||  @#.##
#			B/>%R,  %1,   %2,   %3
#			F=>(%R rows)
#		;
#
# Note that the whitespace between the database fields is irrelevant to the
# parsing, and that the header is still using the default values.
#
# While ->format sections are generally only useful for select statements,
# you could use a F=> subsection to change the output of an insert, update,
# or delete.  Header and body subsections in non-select's are ignored.
#
# Sometimes you may not want to see any output at all if there are no rows
# in the data.  With or without a ->format, you would still see the header
# and footer lines (unless you have a ->format that has no header or footer).
# If this is undesireable, you may use something like the following:
#
#			select *
#			from my_table
#		->suppress_empty
#		;
#
# This would work with a ->format section as well.
#
# If you just need to print some text, with no SQL involved, you can use a
# &print command, as follows:
#
#			&print Here is some text
#
# This is the one time you do not need a semicolon terminator.  Any
# whitespace between the &print and the text, or between the text and the
# newline is stripped; whitespace inside the text, and the newline itself,
# are preserved.  If you need to print more than one line at a time, you
# may do this:
#
#			&print
#				This gets printed exactly, including leading whitespace.
#				Trailing whitespace would be preserved as well.
#
#				There is a blank line above this.
#			;
#
# Note that this is the only time that blank lines are preserved.  Do not
# try to mix these methods; the example below yields an error.
#
#			&print Some text here ...
#				And more down here ...
#				This is an error.
#			;
#
# You can call "stored procedures" by using the &proc command:
#
#			&proc my_procedure
#
#				where something
#
#			;
#
# All stored procedures take a chunk of text, which they typically interpret
# as a piece of a SQL query.  Whatever text they return is output.  Some
# stored procedures are contained in DataStore::procs (which see), but others
# may be added by your own modules.  The key is that they must "register"
# themselves with the DataStore (see DataStore/procs.pm for examples).
#
# You can have the parser ignore large chunks of text like this:
#
#			&ignore
#
#				# here's some old SQL we don't want to run any more,
#				# but we don't want to get rid of it either
#				select *
#				from my_table
#			;
#
# Don't forget that # comments get stripped out by the parser.  Comments
# such as /* */ surrounded comments would get passed on to the SQL query
# (or & command, if they were inside one of those).  But a terminator is
# absolute, so this is going to get you into trouble:
#
#			/*
#				select *
#				from my_table
#				;
#			*/
#
# Best to stick with # comments only if you can.
