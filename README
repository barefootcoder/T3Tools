This is the code that composed the various incarnations of T3Tools.  It originally existed in CVS,
was converted to Subversion, and now it's been converted to git (primarily to make it easier to
steal bits of it for other projects).  The very first version of timer was written way back in 1992,
although the repo only goes back to 1998.  Most of T3Tools was in Perl, but there was a native
Windows Talker client written in C++ (thanks to Jay Vilhena of Oaesys, who was contracting for us at
the time).  It went through several different databases, including dBASE III+ (!!), Sybase, and
MySQL.

For more info on what T3Tools was supposed to be (or supposed to have been), contact us by raising
an issue here on Github, the new home for T3Tools.  In the meantime, have fun poking around.

But don't use this code.
