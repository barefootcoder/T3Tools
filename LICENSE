FAQ (Frequently Anticipated Questions)

Q)  Are you aware that Creative Commons specifically discourages use of their licenses for software?
A)  Yes.

Q)  So why did you use it then?
A)  This license says what I wanted to say.  None of the standard open-source licenses that I looked
    at did.  So I either had to create my own license, or use one that was not recommended.  This
    seemed like the lesser of two evils.  If I were to find a different license that did maintain
    the spirit of what I wanted to say, I would probably switch to that.

Q)  What _is_ the spirit of what you want to say?
A)  I don't want the code used for commercial projects.  That's the big thing.

Q)  Well, as far as I'm concerned, that means this isn't open source software!
A)  I'm okay with that.

Q)  You can't put up non-open-source software on a free GitHub account!
A)  Well, first of all I didn't agree with your opinion above.  But, anyway: that isn't my
    understanding of the GitHub policy.  If I'm wrong, then I'll have to revisit this.

Q)  It's almost like you don't _want_ me to use your code!
A)  You're right: "want" is far too strong a word about how I feel about you using my code.  I
    certainly don't _mind_ you using it.  But it's not like I'm losing sleep if you don't.  Heck,
    didn't you read the README file?

Q)  What if I really want to use your code in my commercial product?
A)  Well, first of all, I think you're insane.  But contact me and we'll work out a separate
    licensing agreement.

Q)  Why would anyone want to pay for this code?  It's not very good!
A)  Yes, I mentioned that in the README file.  You really should have read that first.  That's what
    it's there for, you know.

Q)  So why even bring it up at all?!?
A)  Hey, if you happen to be insane _and_ rich, and have a burning desire to pay me for my crappy
    code, what am I gonna do? say no?  Don't be silly.
