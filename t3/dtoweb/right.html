CHANGELOG<p>
08-22-01<p>
* finished DTO import. The DB is now includes the exported DTO database. All
 functions work, at least as near as I can tell. I am going to announce the
 release. There are still a couple bugs, though...
08-17-01<p>
* changed apache config to exclude "*.inc" files from view, so database
  passwords and whatnot can be included there safely. Only the server can
  see them, they will not ever be sent to the browser. Neat.<p>
08-09-01<p>
* pretty CSS stolen from various places, working on cosmetic stuff until
buddy completes import script(s).<br>
* touched up the odd bit here and there.<p>
08-02-01<p>
* added company field<br>
* fixed up forms a little<br>
* adjusted table create script<br>
<p>
07-14-01<p>
* moved database attributes into config file<br>
* added edit function. kinda not working ATM.<br>
*
