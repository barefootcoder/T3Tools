About this.<p>
There's this app, see, called 'Day Timer'. Its a huge, powerful phone/address
database (among other things). Its sucky and slow, but its hard to replace
because its pretty complete. I wanted something on the web; I mean, shit, at
times someone would <em>call the office</em> to get a phone number. In the age
of networks and the Web, this offends me. We were basically tied to this
piece-of-shit program, too. That also offends me. I wanted a web version.
<p>
I tried to get something working. I sucked; I didn't know enough to make it
happen. I tried playing with Sybase; it's just huge and complex, and doing silly
shit on a production database server isn't a great idea. 
<p>
Time passes. I now have something working. It is my intention to make a simple
"app" that will get the job done. It is also my intention to have the code be
extended. I don't plan on having every possible feature, but I'd like to have
everyone work on this. An open-source project, so to speak.
<p>
You'll note that my DB schema is stupid. I don't know shit about SQL. I'm
learning a lot as I go. Please, don't comment on the stupidity of the tables.
Instead, tell me what's wrong and fix it (or tell me what's wrong and how to fix
it so I can do it). 
<p>
Another thing. It's really lame. If it isn't used, it'll never get any better.
Let's see <b>constructive</b> feedback, please.
