Technical notes: a FAQ<p>
1. Why PHP and not Perl?<br>
The whole thing started out as a lark. I start lots of projects and never
even get them half-usable. I wanted to do something in PHP. So I sat down
and wrote the basics.
<p>
The design of the thing is more like an interim step. I understand that it
can't take LOADS of data, a gajillion hits, or any of that stuff. It isn't
the design.
<p>
The problem I was trying to solve was that DTo held all our phone numbers,
and was therefore useless to anyone not at the office. So I hacked up a web
form.
<p>
It may turn out that it's the "third T". I hope so. And it may turn out that
someone will re-write it using Perl (or C++ or Java or LISP.... etc). It may
be in the long run that this happens, merely to keep t3 a "unified
platform", and not a hodgepodge of parts.
<p>
But the fact remains: I believe it was quicker in PHP, and quick was my
goal. Not scalable, not super functional. It needed to fulfill a job, and
quickly. So here you have it.
<p>
2. Why MySQL?<br>
Pretty much the same as the answer to #1. The DB needed three qualities:
ease of use, speed, and robustness, in that order. MySQL is stupidly easy to
use. MySQL is fast (for reasonable data sets). MySQL is more robust than
flatfiles or hacked-up solutions, and doesn't crash much. <p>
"But [real RDBMS] is better!!!" Yeah. So? Port it. Note that rapid
implementation was one of the goals, and MySQL BLOWS EVERY OTHER RDBMS OUT
OF THE FUCK WATER as a 'RAD' tool. It can run on my laptop, for fucks sake.
Let's see you run Sybase or Oracrap on your laptop, and still maintain a
reasonable level of performance! 
<p>
If MySQL can't handle the loads - ie, fails the robustness qualifier - then
we'll port it. We'll prolly port it eventually, anyway. But remember: my
primary goal was to get it happening, FAST. MySQL is the right tool for that
job.
<p>
3. Something's broken, and I want to report a bug.<br>
OK. Tell me. I'll set up a bugzilla project.
<p>
4. I want it to work differently.<br>
OK. Check the code out. it's under t3/dtoweb. Please don't break anything.
<p>
5. Nice!<br>
Thanks. I was someone would like it.
